  text: "## Our Rules"

  rules:
    Follow Discord's Rules: >-
      We're obliged to enforce Discord's rules, as a project that mostly exists on Discord - that means that everyone must follow the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/terms/guidelines).
    
    Try to Speak English: >-
      While we understand that not everyone speaks native-level English, it's the common language in our spaces - which means we're unable to moderate messages written in other languages. Please give it your best shot, and feel free to use translation tools if you need to - we will not tolerate users that make fun of anyone for their level of English.

    Legal and Ethical Projects Only: >-
      All projects shared and worked on here must be legal, legitimate and appropriate. Do not promote or seek help with projects that break Discord's rules or terms, or the terms of any organisation. Additionally, do not seek help with any code that works with generative AI tools (such as Midjourney or ChatGPT), NFTs or cryptocurrency.
    
    Respect Other Users: >-
      This is a collaborative project, and it's important that everyone respects each other's differences and accounts for others' accessibility needs. To be more specific:

      - Absolutely no bigotry will be tolerated - including, but not limited to, racism, ableism, sexism, classism, transphobia, pluralphobia and queerphobia

      - Keep all discussions "safe for work" - sexual/lewd content (and behaviour), gore, violence and abuse content have no place in this server

      - Likewise, there is no place here for threats or blackmail, piracy, or any other discriminatory or illegal behaviour

      - Respect those that use [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me) here, and only make use of it for [plurality](https://morethanone.info) or self-identity purposes, or as a mental health aid

      - Do not post images, emotes or videos with fast-moving animations or flashing colours, or anything else that's likely to be a problem for a photosensitive user

      If you need to report a problem, you can mention <@&1121521780021006466> directly in any channel, or you can send a DM to a moderator or admin. Reports will always be handled privately, and we'll do our best to protect your identity when dealing with them.

    Respect the Space: >-
      In order for us to do discuss things productively, it's important that you respect the Discord server. To be more specific:

      - Do not spam under any circumstances - and note that this includes dumping memes into an off-topic channel, regardless of other context

      - Read the channel descriptions and make sure your discussions are on-topic for the channels you're using
